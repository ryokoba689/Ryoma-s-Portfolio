I've changed and added my own flair to my portfolio displaying some of the things I have learned and currently still learning. Some of the elements will be fixed and changed over time as I learn new ways to code and apply what I have learned from the course.
I was able to get the forms section working but the box of the forms section would change color or not fit form size so I returned to original with plans to rework in the future.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
